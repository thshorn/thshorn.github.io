I am a Phd at ...

I am interested in factors that impede learning and thus lead to sub-optimal performance. Currently, I am examining the impact of temporal and perceptual uncertainty on action inhibition, particularly in relation to the involvement of dopamine. I am also interested in the effect of female hormones on both action inhibition and risk perception during different transitional phases.
