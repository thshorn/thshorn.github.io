I am a Phd at the Department of Computational Neuroscience of the [Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics](https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/en) & Eberhard Karls University TÃ¼bingen under supervision of [Peter Dayan](https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/95844/223806).

I am interested in factors that impede learning and thus lead to sub-optimal performance. Currently, I am examining the impact of temporal and perceptual uncertainty on action inhibition, particularly in relation to the involvement of dopamine. I am also interested in the effect of female hormones on both action inhibition and risk perception during different transitional phases.
