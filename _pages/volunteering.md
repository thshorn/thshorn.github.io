**Pint of Science**
Pint of Science Tübingen is an annual talk series designed to make science more accessible to the general public. It was successfully relaunched in Tübingen in 2024 with three engaging evenings at local bars, featuring three talks each night. I support the fundraising team and am already excited to help organize the event again in 2025 with even more volunteers. If you want to learn more about the event, please visit the [Pint of Science Tübingen website](https://pintofscience.de/about/). If you are interested in joining our team for next year’s organization, please reach out to me or anyone else on the team, as we always welcome more help.

**NeNa conference**
The [NeNa Conference](https://nenaconference.wordpress.com/) is a three-day neuroscience conference designed for early-career researchers, particularly PhD students. It highlights the connections between cellular, molecular, behavioral, cognitive and theoretical neuroscience.
